# Contact Log
History:
This script has its history in a problem at work of having lots of calls but no easy way to log all the contacts I've had with clients. In other programs, it can take several pages and prompts just to document the date a client has called me. This script will open up a file for each client and keep a running log of all the dates that you have had contact. 
Mechanics:
All you have to do is enter the client's name. 
You can also decide to add a note if you want to. 
The program will open a file (or create a file) based on your input "client's name".txt. 
Ths script will automatically add the current date as a new line in the file and the note if necessary.
